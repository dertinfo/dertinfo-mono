# New-stack Bicep, GitHub Flow, and src/infra CD

## Summary of the work completed

Added RG-scoped Bicep under `infra/bicep/` for **config** (Key Vault + App Configuration Free), **monitoring** (Log Analytics with a 1 GB/day ingest cap + Application Insights), **storage** (images Storage Account always; SQL Basic when prerequisites exist), and **api** (Windows App Service when prerequisites exist). Subscription foundation now includes a `monitoring` resource group and extra RBAC on the config RG (Key Vault Secrets User + User Access Administrator). Infra CD workflows deploy each part to GitHub Environments `development` then gated `production`.

Aligned branching with [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow): no `develop` branch. Path-filtered `*-src-ci.yml` runs on pull requests **into `main`**. `*-src-cd.yml` and `*-infra-cd.yml` run on **push to `main`**. Reusable workflows are `reusable-src-*` and `reusable-infra-*`. Cursor rule [`.cursor/rules/github-flow.mdc`](../../../.cursor/rules/github-flow.mdc) replaces gitflow.

Changelog detail pages are `YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-short-slug.md` so several entries on one day sort in the file list. House guidance: [changelogs.mdc](../../../.cursor/rules/changelogs.mdc), [changelog index](./README.md), [documentation guide](../../documentation-guide.md).

Bicep house rules: [docs/technical/standards/bicep/](../../technical/standards/bicep/). CI/CD: [cicd.md](../../technical/infra/cicd.md). Contributing: [contributing workflow](../../technical/guides/contributing-workflow.md). A future Linux App Service move is recorded in [cicd-future-phase.md](../planned-fixes/cicd-future-phase.md).

## Issues that were encountered on the way

- Key Vault names cannot include the `config` part token (`kv-<env>-dertinfo-config-uks` is 26 characters). Used `kv-<env>-dertinfo-uks` (19).
- Storage account names cannot contain hyphens. Used `stdevdertinfoimagesuks` / `stprddertinfoimagesuks` (`prd`, not `prod`) so the account is identified as public images, leaving room for other (non-public) accounts in the same RG.
- AVM `web/site` 0.24.0 does not accept `appSettingsKeyValuePairs`; app settings go on `siteConfig.appSettings`. Publishing credential policies are an array, not an object.
- `existing` + `getSecret()` must live in a local module gated by `prerequisitesExist`, or ARM looks up the Key Vault even when SQL is skipped.
- The subscription policy module kept the App Service and SQL SKU assignments but dropped the built-in **Allowed resource types** assignment (`di-policy-allowed-types-<env>`). That was restored with the extended allow-list (KV secrets, App Config key-values, LAW/AI children, SQL/storage extras, `Microsoft.Web/sites/extensions`). Incremental ARM would have left the existing Azure assignment in place with the old list; IaC would have stopped updating it.
- Azure SQL cannot turn off automated backups. Development uses 1-day PITR (the minimum); production uses 7-day PITR with **Local** backup storage redundancy. Policy allow-list includes `Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/backupShortTermRetentionPolicies`.
- Path-filtered CI jobs are skipped when a PR does not touch those paths. If those job names are **required** status checks, GitHub can block the PR. Use a ruleset that allows skipped checks, or only require checks that always run.
- Two 2026-08-30 changelog pages were still untracked, so `git mv` failed for those; they were renamed on disk instead.

## Any remaining issues that we may wish to address

- Operator must seed `sql-dertinfo-storage-administrator-login` and `sql-dertinfo-storage-administrator-password` in each Key Vault, then re-run storage infra CD.
- Populate App Configuration labelled keys (Auth0, SQL connection shape, and so on) so the API can start against the new stack.
- Re-run subscription foundation CD so the `monitoring` RGs and config-RG extra roles exist.
- Web / app / functions src CD will fail until those Azure resources and tokens exist.
- Linux App Service migration (see [cicd-future-phase.md](../planned-fixes/cicd-future-phase.md)).
- Image blob storage public access is enabled to match the current API; tighten later if the app moves to private blobs.
- Turn on branch protection / a ruleset on `main`: require a PR, require up-to-date branches, and require the CI job names that should gate merge. This cannot be done from workflow YAML alone.
