# System capability: Authenticated session

## Purpose

The platform can recognise a signed-in user for the duration of a valid session and associate subsequent actions with that user.

## Behaviour

- After [log in](../features/auth-login.md), the platform treats the user as authenticated.
- [Stay signed in](../features/auth-session-continuity.md) describes continuity across navigations.
- [Log out](../features/auth-logout.md) ends the session.

## Dependencies

None at the capability layer (see technical docs for how sessions are implemented).

## Security considerations

- Session continuity must not elevate privileges beyond the user’s roles.
- Ending a session must revoke access to protected capabilities.

> Starter stub — implementation-free; expand during reverse-engineering.
