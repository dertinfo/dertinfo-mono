# Domain glossary

Product language for DertInfo. The platform supports **sword-dancing clubs** (groups) entering **Dert** and similar events. Implementation detail lives under technical docs — this page is capability vocabulary only. Lifecycle, actions, and states for each object are on the [entity pages](../README.md#entities).

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **[Group](../entities/group.md)** | A club / organisation with members (e.g. a sword-dancing side). Any signed-in website user may create a group. |
| **[Member](../entities/group-member.md)** | A person belonging to a group. Members are not permanently assigned to teams in the software. |
| **[Guest](../entities/group-member.md)** | An attendee on a registration treated like a member for booking, but labelled as a non-dancer companion (e.g. spouse). When capacity is tight, guests are typically reduced before dancers. |
| **[Team](../entities/team.md)** | A subset of group members formed to enter team activities / competitions (often around five dancers). |
| **[Event](../entities/event.md)** | A gathering (notably **Dert**) that hosts activities and competitions. Created by an event administrator via a wizard. |
| **Event type** | Template chosen when creating an event; defines the predefined activity and competition structure. |
| **[Activity](../entities/activity.md)** | A bookable item on an event. Two kinds: **team activity** and **member activity**. |
| **[Team activity](../entities/activity.md)** | Competition-style entry for a team (may have a price). Competitions are team activities that are judged. |
| **[Member activity](../entities/activity.md)** | Ticket-style entry for people attending (e.g. adult, junior, concession). |
| **[Competition](../entities/competition.md)** | A judged team activity within an event. A typical **Dert** has four: **Main** (five venues), **Traditional** (different marking set), **Spotlight**, and **DERTY** (Dancing England Rapper Tournament Youth; different marking set). A team may enter one or more. Multi-venue competitions aggregate scores across venues. |
| **[Award](../entities/competition.md)** | A prize within a competition. For main competition typically includes best newcomer, veterans, **Steve Marris** (includes characters), and **overall winner** (excludes characters). |
| **[Venue](../entities/venue.md)** | Place where (part of) a competition is judged. |
| **[Dance](../entities/dance.md)** | A team's performance at a venue within a competition — the unit being scored. |
| **[Judge](../entities/judge.md)** | Person scoring at a venue (typically two per venue). |
| **[Score category](../entities/score-category.md)** | A marking criterion. Typical main set: music, stepping, sword handling, dance technique, presentation, characters, buzz. Traditional and DERTY use different marking sets. |
| **[Score set](../entities/score-set.md)** | A set of score categories allocated to a judge. |
| **[Score](../entities/score.md)** | A judge's mark against a score category for a particular dance. |
| **[Registration](../entities/registration.md)** | A group's submitted request for an event (activities and tickets). Remains **unconfirmed** until the event organiser confirms after the registration period. |
| **[Invoice](../entities/invoice.md)** | Created when registrations are confirmed; sent to the group secretary with pricing and payment instructions. Event admins can mark invoices paid; group admins can see that status. |
| **[Results published](../entities/competition.md)** | Competition flag set by the event admin after the awards ceremony. Publishes award outcomes publicly and unlocks own-team scores/sheets in the app. |
| **[Dert of Derts (DoD)](../entities/dod-submission.md)** | Separate online programme: public viewing of uploaded dance videos with [scoring and feedback](../entities/dod-result.md) against marking criteria — isolated from core event/competition administration. |
