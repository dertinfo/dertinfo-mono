## Description

A place where part of a [competition](competition.md) is judged. A competition can use more than one venue. The main Dert competition uses five. Scores from those venues are added together for the competition result.

## What can be done

- **Attach to a competition** — event-admin. The competition is then judged at that venue.
- **Assign judges** — event-admin. Each judge at the venue is given a [score set](score-set.md). See [Judge](judge.md).
- **Capture scores** — venue-admin or event-admin, via [Venue score capture](../features/venue-score-capture.md). Scores and [marking sheet](marking-sheet.md) photos are taken for each [dance](dance.md) at the venue.
