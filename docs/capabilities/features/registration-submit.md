# Feature: Submit event registration

## Description

A group secretary or administrator registers their group for an event by choosing team and member activities (and guests where needed), then submitting. Submission is not the same as confirmation.

## User roles

- **group-member** — from the group homepage, open **Registrations** and see **Available / New** events that can be registered for
- **group-admin** — open, fill, submit, and amend registrations for groups they administer

## Behaviour

- From the group homepage, **Registrations** then **Available / New** lists configured events whose registration open date is before today and whose registration close date is after today.
- When a registration is available, the group administrator proceeds to the group registration configuration and leaves the registration **New**.
- From the group homepage, **Active** opens that registration. Add a member from the members tab, a guest from the guests tab, and a team from the attending-teams tab.
- The individual activity is offered to the member and the guest. The team activity is offered to the team.
- Edit the registration while it is still **New**, and see the change saved.
- **Submit** changes the status to **Submitted**.
- The group administrator can still change a **Submitted** registration. Editing stops once an event admin **confirms** it.
- Submission notifies event admins that a registration is ready to inspect.
- A **registration submitted** email is sent automatically — see [Registration email templates](registration-email-templates.md) and [Send email](send-email.md).

## Limitations

- Confirmation, invoicing, and capacity decisions are event-admin capabilities — see [Confirm registrations](registration-confirm.md).
- A group that is not set up can still register. An event that is not set up is not listed under **Available / New** and cannot be registered for.
- There is no local mailbox in this estate. Submission is checked on the registration screen. The registration-submitted emails are not checked from the website.
