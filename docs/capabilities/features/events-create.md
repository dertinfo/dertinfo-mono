# Feature: Create event

## Description

An event administrator can create a new **event** (e.g. a Dert) from the dashboard using a wizard and an **event type** template that defines the activity and competition structure.

## User roles

- **event-admin** — create and then administer events they are authorised for

## Behaviour

- From the dashboard, start **Create New Event**.
- Follow the wizard and choose an **event type**.
- The event type supplies a predefined template for activities and competitions for that event.
- A new event is not set up. Its dashboard card shows **Needs more information**, and the menu offers **Configure**.
- Until that setup is finished, the event is not offered to groups under **Registrations** → **Available / New**, and a group cannot open a registration for it.
- Setup collects dates, contact name, telephone, registration open and close, the event type, and acceptance of the terms. Submit lands on the event screen.
- From the event home, the administrator can change the event details and dates, including when registration opens and the event date, and save them.
- The event **Overview** shows how many members and guests, teams, and registrations are coming.
- **Gallery** shows the event images. The administrator can upload a photo and **Set Main** so that image is the public event image.
- **Activities** can include an individual activity and a team activity. See [Submit event registration](registration-submit.md).

## Limitations

- Ordinary members cannot create events unless they have event-admin authority (typically provisioned for organisers).

See [Domain glossary](../system/domain-glossary.md).
