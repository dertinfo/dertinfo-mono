# Feature: Confirm registrations

## Description

Event administrators inspect submitted registrations during the registration period and, when capacity allows, confirm them. Confirmation creates invoices for group secretaries.

## User roles

- **event-admin** — inspect and confirm registrations for their events

## Behaviour

- Review submitted (unconfirmed) registrations from groups.
- At the end of the registration period, decide capacity; confirm registrations when appropriate.
- Confirmation creates **invoices** and triggers the **registration confirmed** email (invoice, pricing, how to pay) — see [Registration email templates](registration-email-templates.md), [Send email](send-email.md), and [Invoicing](invoicing.md).
- If attendance must be reduced, organisers typically ask groups to cut **guests** before dancers.

## Limitations

- Groups cannot confirm their own registrations.
- Payment collection is outside automated card capture in this overview; marking paid is separate — see [Invoicing](invoicing.md).

See [Domain glossary](../system/domain-glossary.md).
