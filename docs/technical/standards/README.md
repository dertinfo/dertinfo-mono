# Engineering standards

Technology-wide conventions (style, constructs, naming) that apply wherever that stack is used in the monorepo — not product capabilities and not per-app getting started.

| Technology | Guide |
|------------|--------|
| [Angular](angular/) | Client structure and DertInfo feature pattern (conductor / tracker / repository / resolver) |
| [Bicep](bicep/) | `infra/bicep` layout, AVM vs local modules, extendable params, `prerequisitesExist` |
| [PowerShell](powershell/) | `infra/scripts` layout, comment-based help, and operator-script body order |

Create a new folder under `standards/` when documenting the first house standard for another stack (e.g. .NET).
